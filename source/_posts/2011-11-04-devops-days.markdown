I had the good fortune to attend [Devopsdays Goteborg](http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-goteborg/) a few weeks back, and met a whole bunch of wonderful people. Many thanks to the legendary, words-cannot-do-this-man-justice [Patrick Debois](http://www.jedi.be/) and the other organisers.

Whilst there seemed to be a lots of fantastic, enlightening conversation around the devops space, there also seemed to be a lot of complaints about lack of sponsorship for devops from those people in "the business". I took my usual subtle, sensitive approach to a perceived problem and proposed an open space to explore the problem entitled "F**k devops, noone cares, where's my money?". Whilst I undermined myself somewhat by turning up late for my own openspace, my ideas didn't seem to get a huge amount of traction.

**"The business case for devops"** (very faint on the board)

This was probably because there was a tools-orientated openspace happening in another room.

Devops's achilles heel is the potential it has for being introspective(ignore the ITIL/process arguments; absolute nonsense) and purely tooling focused. Changing the THEM and US attitude from dev vs ops to devops vs [THE MANAGEMENT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CiGUMQZUgU) just shifts the issue. Patrick Debois brilliantly summarises that we should, instead, be thinking about [\*dev\*ops*](http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devopsdays-downundervfinal); unfortunately some of the devops people I've met seem to be more interested in teaming up against others than including them.

I'm taking a look at how I think we can address this problem, by perhaps changing the focus from "delivering" to "delivering value". Coming from a devops background, I'm obviously going to create a tool to help me. That should teach those management types a lesson.
