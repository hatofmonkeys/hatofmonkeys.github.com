  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="http://blog.hatofmonkeys.com/blog/2014/12/25/the-twelve-blogs-of-christmas/">31st December, Blog #7</a></h2>

<h2>Multi-Site Cloud Foundry</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudcredo.com">CloudCredo&rsquo;s</a> clients often ask about how to run Cloud Foundry across multiple sites for performance and resilience. This is a natural question to ask: as an application developer, if I specify that I need to have ten instances of my application available, I expect ten instances to be available &ndash; whether the underlying infrastructure is available or not. The Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS) abstraction implies that my application should continue to run as desired, and that the PaaS should be designed to handle failures in the infrastructure layer.</p>

<h3>Choosing a CAP</h3>

<p>This idea sounds great in theory but can lead to some problems in practice. What should Cloud Foundry do, as a distributed system, in the event of a network partition? Should each partition converge on the desired state of the whole system, leading to twice the number of applications being online, and potential split-brain issues with singleton applications? Should the whole Cloud Foundry shut down to ensure application consistency? The key point to note here, which is not immediately obvious, is that whilst Cloud Foundry hosts <em>stateless</em> applications, it is actually a <em>stateful</em> system itself. This means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP theorem</a> must be obeyed; we can opt for consistency or availability in our Cloud Foundry deployment.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry has, at its core, a Cloud Controller database maintaining the desired state of the system. If we maintain a single, consistent state of this database we will be running a CP(consistent, partition-tolerant) Cloud Foundry. If we allow multiple, divergent copies of this database we will be running an AP(available, partition-tolerant) Cloud Foundry.</p>

<h3>Consistent Cloud Foundry</h3>

<p>Cloud Foundry&rsquo;s current engineering direction seems to favour a consistent view of the desired application state. This is exhibited by the choice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_%28computer_science%29">Raft</a> as a consensus algorithm, and <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">Etcd</a> as an implementation, for CF&rsquo;s next generation <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release">Diego</a> components. These choices pose some difficult questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we suffer thundering herd issues in the event of a network partition, where all desired instances of all applications attempt to run on the nodes with access to the quorate Etcd partition?</li>
<li>How do we ensure data services, required by the applications, are accessible from the functioning side of a partition?</li>
<li>How do we ensure latency to data services from across multiple sites does not reduce application performance below acceptable levels?</li>
<li>What happens if the Cloud Foundry components themselves experience issues, degrading the service as a whole across all sites?</li>
</ul>


<p>Running a consistent Cloud Foundry makes application deployment and management very easy; there is a single API endpoint for management. At CloudCredo we deploy consistent Cloud Foundry installations across multiple availability zones within a single region. This mitigates the latency concerns and provides a convenient management structure for application deployment.</p>

<h3>Available Cloud Foundry</h3>

<p>When I&rsquo;ve needed to deploy Cloud Foundry across multiple regions it has usually been to provide for a very high availability service level. To provide for this I have deployed multiple, completely separate Cloud Foundry installations, often on heterogeneous infrastructure providers, in diverse regions. An example of this kind of installation would be the <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2013/04/30/uk-charity-raises-record-donations-powered-by-cloud-foundry/">donations platform for Comic Relief</a>. The huge benefit of this strategy is that no outages in any individual Cloud Foundry can stop the service &ndash; availability is maximised. The two major downsides are that deployment and orchestration of applications becomes significantly more complex, and that the applications and data services need to be developed to handle being deployed in a distributed system of this nature.</p>

<h3>The Perfect Cloud Foundry?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently deploying multi-zone &lsquo;consistent CF&rsquo; &ndash; and then multi-region &lsquo;available CF&rsquo; if requirements demand it. This is a domain specific choice; and it takes a significant amount of work in the application(particularly around state) to bring multi-region availability.</p>

<h2>PaaSaaP and the Distro Wars</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/527680598543187968">Cloud Foundry has won the PaaS war</a>. Heroku blazed the trail with their PaaS for <a href="http://12factor.net/">Twelve-Factor Apps</a>, and VMWare/Pivotal have built an open-source implementation and ecosystem to provide both enterprises and developers with an obvious choice. Buildpacks have become the standard for translation from application code to runnable unit.</p>

<p>The question is rapidly changing from &ldquo;which PaaS are you using?&rdquo; to &ldquo;which distribution of Cloud Foundry are you using?&rdquo;. Just as Hadoop became synonymous with big data so Cloud Foundry has become PaaS. The emerging battle is between the distribution vendors; Pivotal, IBM, HP and ActiveState already have offerings in the market. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see more from other players as the <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org/about/index.html">Cloud Foundry Foundation</a> gains momentum.</p>

<p>The other fascinating aspect of the development of the Cloud Foundry ecosystem is &lsquo;Platform as a Service&rsquo; versus &lsquo;Platform as a Service as a Product&rsquo;(PaaSaaP). Some vendors are offering Cloud Foundry as installable, supported software &ndash; where the onus is on the customer to deploy the software to their chosen infrastructure in order to provide a service. Other vendors are deploying and running Cloud Foundry on behalf of their uses to provide a true PaaS experience. A few vendors are offering both. Some PaaS purists have denigrated Cloud Foundry for offering this flexibility, but I see this as one of Cloud Foundry&rsquo;s greatest strengths. Developers can minimise Time-to-Value by deploying quickly to a vendor&rsquo;s cloud-based solution &ndash; and then deploy Cloud Foundry to their own infrastructure when non-functional requirements emerge to make a custom deployment necessary.</p>

<p>We will also see domain-specific Cloud Foundy implementations for particular markets. The &lsquo;core&rsquo; Cloud Foundry specification, provided by the CF Foundation, will provide a key set of capabilities and an API for developers to work against &ndash; but we will see extensions providing for additional requirements and innovation. Time will tell which flavours of Cloud Foundry are successful and which are left behind.</p>

<h2>Twelve Factor Enterprise</h2>

<p>The big paradigm shift for developers using Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS) is understanding <a href="http://12factor.net/">&ldquo;The Twelve-Factor App&rdquo;</a>; a set of patterns developed by the team at Heroku enabling applications to be orchestrated and distributed at scale. By adopting these patterns developers can take advantage of PaaS, via services such as Heroku and Cloud Foundry, reducing their operational responsibilities so they can focus on delivering value.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a long-running debate with various members of the PaaS community about 12-Factor&rsquo;s relevance to enterprises. I&rsquo;ve heard many claims that enterprises don&rsquo;t want to adopt these patterns, and would rather mix their state, config, and application together as a tangled ball of mud. At a board level the enterprises I&rsquo;ve worked for, and interacted with, have been seeking organisational agility &ndash; the kind of fast delivery and iteration PaaS brings to software development. Somehow this message often gets lost in middle management, leading to a resistance to change and clinging to legacy practices like a safety blanket.</p>

<p>We need to stop telling enterprises that modern patterns, such as 12 Factor and Microservices, won&rsquo;t work for them. We need to help enterprises to lower their time-to-value and increase their operational efficiency. The only winners from keeping enterprises stuck in the dark ages are the incumbent vendors, happy to continue charging extortionate prices for outdated systems and software.</p>

<p>Enterprises can adopt 12 Factor, Microservices, and PaaS. They want to be more agile, not less. Let&rsquo;s help them.</p>

<h2>Containers as a Service</h2>

<p>At a simple level, Infrastructure-as-a-Service deals with virtual machines, Platform-as-a-Service deals with applications, and Software-as-a-Service deals with users. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2014/07/dockercon-video/">spoken a few times</a> about Containers-as-a-Service(CaaS) &ndash; the idea that containers will become a new meaningful unit of currency in cloud computing. I&rsquo;ve also <a href="http://www.cloudcredo.com/pulling-paas-to-pieces/">written about the ramifications of CaaS for PaaS</a>.</p>

<p>The hottest debate in the container ecosystem seems to be whether to use containers as single processes or multi-process virtual machines. The Docker folks seem to encourage the use of single process containers &ndash; a view I&rsquo;m supportive of, following principles from software development, such as single responsibility and inversion of control. The alternative approach is to use containers as virtual machines with many processes. The virtual machine approach seems to resonate well with the current generation of operating systems and configuration management tooling.</p>

<p>I believe both approaches will continue to thrive for some time. The true value in Docker lies in the packaging and portability of containers, and this holds true whether you&rsquo;re packaging filesystems for a single process or a number of processes. Containers used as virtual machines will quickly erode the IaaS market &ndash; if only for their portability, speed, and density. Consumers and producers can gain benefits when choosing the CaaS abstraction over IaaS.</p>

<p>Over time there will be a move towards per-process containers, away from virtual machine-like containers, as the deployment and orchestration benefits from this approach become clearer. Just as SOLID, and TDD took time to gain momentum in software development so the correct patterns for containers will gain traction over time.</p>

<p>We will also see increasing numbers of customised operating systems, designed to run with the Linux kernel but providing a subset of the functionality, tuned for single-purpose containers. <a href="http://osv.io/">OSv</a> is a great example of this. I also think we&rsquo;re likely to see an increasing number of container host OSs, presenting something that looks like a Linux kernel to hosted containers, under development. The boundaries between hypervisor and namespaced kernel will blur.</p>

<p>The other main areas for innovation will be storage and networking. Providing containers with reliable storage for mutable state is challenging. The ClusterHQ folks have made great progress in this area using ZFS-on-Linux in <a href="https://github.com/clusterhq/flocker">Flocker</a>. There are also exciting developments in the networking space from <a href="http://socketplane.io/">SocketPlane</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zettio/weave">Weave</a> &ndash; simplifying multi-host container networking.</p>

<p>CaaS solutions have already emerged from the big cloud players; you can easily host containers on GCE, AWS, and Azure. <a href="http://www.rancher.io/">Rancher</a> looks to enable CaaS on any infrastructure. Pivotal&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/lattice">Lattice</a> enables operators to deliver their own CaaS, as does its big brother Cloud Foundry. These solutions are currently largely focused towards Docker but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see Rocket and alternatives emerge.</p>

<p>Whilst the future may look bright for containers, there are some warning signs. Multi-tenant container isolation and security are currently far from production ready. It also seems that choosing a layered filesystem beneath your containers can be a risky business; I&rsquo;ve been bitten by few bugs.</p>

<p>I think CaaS will grow exponentially over the next few years. <a href="https://www.tutum.co/">Tutum</a> are building the first pure CaaS I&rsquo;ve seen. They attracted $2.65M in seed funding this year. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll have plenty of competition in the near future.</p>

<h2>The Heterogeneous Workforce</h2>

<p>I enjoy regularly visiting and speaking at tech conferences. They&rsquo;re a great way to stay abreast of trends and keep a fresh perspective on how the industry is delivering value. Unfortunately I&rsquo;m usually dismayed at the homogeneous composition of the conference attendees; the overwhelming majority are white males, like myself.</p>

<p>As a company CEO I see this as a tremendous waste. The key role I play in the company is the recruitment and retention of the members of our great team. Enlarging the pool of resource I can draw from will only increase the quality of the team, the diversity of opinions, and create a balanced working environment. I&rsquo;m not trying to get on my moral high horse; I want a better team so I can make more money.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in PaaS, distributed systems, and Extreme Programming, please do contact <a href="http://www.cloudcredo.com/contact-us/">CloudCredo</a> &ndash; especially if you don&rsquo;t &lsquo;fit the mould&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re looking for fast learners and good communicators. I&rsquo;d love to think there&rsquo;s a pool of untapped skills out there I can use to help build our team. I can&rsquo;t promise to run the perfect company, but I can promise to try.</p>

<p>I wrote this blog back in June but didn&rsquo;t have time to publish it. No time like the present.</p>

<h2>Cloud Foundry Summit 2014</h2>

<p>Now the dust has settled following the CF Summit I thought it a good time to note some of the lasting impressions.</p>

<p>CF Summit was a great conference. The buzz and energy around the place was tangible. This year&rsquo;s host, Andrew Clay Shafer, gave the event a friendly, personable feel, and also has(had) great hair. The big hitters from the Cloud Foundry community were present, along with a newer users from a diverse range of organisations.</p>

<p>Personally, I felt the Summit represented the emergence of Cloud Foundry as the leading enterprise PaaS. I backed Cloud Foundry from day one, and I&rsquo;ve been vocal about the <a href="http://blog.hatofmonkeys.com/blog/2013/06/30/when-to-pass-on-a-paas/">shortcomings of other PaaSes that fall short of CF</a>. Witnessing some of the biggest names in tech queuing up to take the stage to endorse Cloud Foundry was immensely gratifying. The corollary to those endorsements was the quantity of real world Cloud Foundry success stories in the talks; Cloud Foundry has broken through, and proven its worth.</p>

<p>One of the chief reasons for the dramatic rise in enterprise adoption of Cloud Foundry has been the <a href="http://www.cloudcredo.com/cloudcredo-joins-the-cloud-foundry-foundation/">formation of the CF Foundation</a>. The Foundation members were well represented at CF Summit, from small innovators such as CloudCredo, to tech giants such as IBM and Cisco. It&rsquo;s fantastic to see the Cloud Foundry ecosystem crystallise as a Foundation to move the project forward.</p>

<p>The noticeable trend amongst the Summit attendees was big businesses realising the importance of speed. Canopy are shining example of this; formed from large enterprises but able to quickly and effectively <a href="http://canopy-cloud.com/">make use of outstanding new technologies</a>. I fear for their competition; it&rsquo;s striking when organisations decisively deliver capability at this scale.</p>

<p>We were overjoyed with the Summit from a CloudCredo perspective. The ecosystem&rsquo;s response to our work with them was fantastic. We are proud our work was mentioned in the following talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy_huSXghI8">Ben Hale&rsquo;s Buildpack Talk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQhRl9GYGpQ">Warner Music</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMNt6Gn3yaI">Canopy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e0XgGevKhg">Cisco</a></li>
<li>James Bayer &ndash; Cloud Foundry Roadmap</li>
<li>Tammer Saleh and Chris Brown &ndash; Cloud Foundry Data Services</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmapwrs2M9c">Ferdy&rsquo;s BOSH/Docker talk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP0fpP_Nl4I">My Decker talk</a></li>
</ul>


<p>We&rsquo;d love to be able to add your organisation&rsquo;s name to that list. Please <a href="http://www.cloudcredo.com/contact-us/">get in contact</a> to talk about how we can help you deliver with Cloud Foundry.</p>

<h3>Twelve blogs, twelve days</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a backlog of half-formed blog posts (backblog?) that have been hanging around, like bad smells, for a while. I&rsquo;ve decided to get them all done and out over Christmas. I&rsquo;m cheating by imposing the following restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the first blog and counts as a blog post even though it&rsquo;s a meta-post</li>
<li>I reserve the right to post days, or even weeks, late. I&rsquo;m in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sark">Sark</a> for some of Christmas and I will be burned alive in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wicker_Man_%281973_film%29">wicker man</a> if I&rsquo;m seen using a laptop</li>
<li>I reserve the right to post nonsense due to Christmas-related alcohol abuse</li>
<li>I reserve the right to blame alcohol for nonsense I&rsquo;ve posted while sober</li>
<li>I have about eight posts lined up, most of which are nonsense</li>
<li>The remaining three posts are TBC and are guaranteed to be nonsense</li>
<li>I reserve the right to edit/delete all blogs at a later date once I realise how nonsensical they are</li>
</ul>


<h3>Random asides</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the vast majority of my traffic is from the USA. As part of my single-handed mission to bring back UK Garage, and further its influence in the world, I will be linking to some of the UKG greats at the end of each blog post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Rocket</h3>

<p>As you&rsquo;re probably aware by now &ndash; CoreOS have released a new container runtime called &lsquo;<a href="https://coreos.com/blog/rocket/">Rocket</a>&rsquo;. Rocket will inevitably be perceived as a reaction, and competitor, to Docker. The language in CoreOS&rsquo;s Rocket blog post suggests Docker have deviated from CoreOS&rsquo;s preferred path, and the tone suggests an accusation of betrayal. The timing of CoreOS&rsquo;s announcement, the week before DockerCon EU, implies a deliberate attempt to undermine Docker&rsquo;s marketing.</p>

<h3>Reaction</h3>

<p>GigaOM have published a great summary of the community&rsquo;s reaction <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/12/02/why-coreos-just-fired-a-rocket-at-docker/">here</a>. Given Docker&rsquo;s amazing ecosystem and adoption levels I&rsquo;m actually quite surprised more people haven&rsquo;t come out in strong support of Docker. Solomon Hykes has exactly three things to say (followed by a subsequent thirteen) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8682525">here</a>.</p>

<h3>The Changing Docker</h3>

<p>I spoke at <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2014/07/dockercon-video/">DockerCon 2014 about the Cloud Foundry/Docker integration</a> project I&rsquo;d been working on. This work has now been subsumed into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e76a50ZgzxM">Docker on Diego</a> work which is beginning to form the core of Cloud Foundry V3. While working on the initial proof of concept I had regular communication with the people at Docker. I found them friendly and open to the idea of using Docker containers as another deployable unit within Cloud Foundry.</p>

<p>Once Docker <a href="http://thenewstack.io/docker-sets-sights-on-enterprises-with-40-million-investment/">raised their $40M investment</a> the tone changed. Docker became a &lsquo;<a href="https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/">platform</a>&rsquo;. Docker&rsquo;s collaboration with Cloud Foundry, to use Docker inside Cloud Foundry, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBfDDnn_Kr0_P8iUubHX3RdvGxQ9isXczhjLW3pMZiM/pub">seemed to stall</a>. It appeared Docker were trying to eat their ecosystem. Was investor pressure for a huge return causing Docker to try to capture too many markets rather than focusing on their core?</p>

<h3>Cloud Foundry Future</h3>

<p>Cloud Foundry will continue to orchestrate various units of currency; applications via buildpacks, containers via Docker, and potentially containers via Rocket. My company, <a href="http://www.cloudcredo.com/">CloudCredo</a>, is already looking at what a Rocket integration with Cloud Foundry would look like. <code>cf push https://storage-mirror.example.com/webapp-1.0.0.aci</code> is on the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Devops is about holistic, systems-orientated thinking; it&rsquo;s been misappropriated to be about configuration management. I&rsquo;ve noticed a decline in the number of people from a development background at Devops conferences &ndash; maybe they&rsquo;ve lost interest in talking about Puppet vs Chef vs Salt vs Ansible vs CFEngine vs X vs Y vs Z?</p>

<h3>Bricks</h3>

<p>The role of infrastructure should be to provide reliable, consumable bricks to enable innovation at higher levels. If we create beautiful, unique, novel bricks it becomes impossible to build houses. This is a problem I see regularly with OpenStack deployments; they&rsquo;re amazing, wonderful, unique, organic. I cannot, however, easily deploy platforms to them.</p>

<h3>Configuration Management</h3>

<p>This issue manifests itself in deployments orchestrated by configuration management.</p>

<ul>
<li>Complexity &ndash; you can do some amazing things in Chef as you have the power and flexibility to run arbitrary Ruby during your deployments. I have seen this abused many times &ndash; and done this myself. Too much clever branching logic and too little reliable code</li>
<li>Determinism &ndash; configuration management tools often provide a thin veneer over non-deterministic operating system commands</li>
<li>Reproducibility &ndash; server scaling operations often fail due to poor dependency management and non-deterministic actions</li>
</ul>


<p>Configuration management is too focused on innovation at the server level rather than thinking about the entire system. Devops has become a silo.</p>

<h3>A Better Way</h3>

<p>There are some tools and patterns emerging to tackle these problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://foodfightshow.org/2013/07/immutable-infrastructure.html">Immutable infrastructure</a> &ndash; remove the drift</li>
<li><a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslNszh3jfY">Decker</a> &ndash; testable, simple, small, disposable containers</li>
<li><a href="http://nixos.org/nix/">Nix</a> &ndash; declarative, deterministic package management</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv">OSV</a> &ndash; stupid(brilliant) operating system to enable innovation</li>
<li><a href="http://bosh.cfapps.io/">BOSH</a> &ndash; stupid(brilliant) tool to deploy complex distributed systems</li>
<li><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Mesos</a> &ndash; schedule commands(jobs) to run in a distributed environment</li>
</ul>


<h3>&lsquo;Infrastructure as Code&rsquo; to &lsquo;Infrastructure as Good Code&rsquo;</h3>

<p>We need <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/60845/The-S-O-L-I-D-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-Prin">SOLID</a> for infrastructure. We need to develop standardised, commoditised, loosely coupled, single-responsibility components from which we can build higher-order systems and services. Only then will we be enabling innovation higher up the value chain.</p>

<p>Devops should be about enabling the business to deliver effectively. We&rsquo;ve got stuck up our own <del>arses</del> configuration management.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s no point pretending I don&rsquo;t love &lsquo;The PaaS&rsquo;. I do. I have spent too much of my career fighting battles I shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting; re-inventing similar-looking systems time and time again. The idea I could just drop an application into a flexible platform and expect it to run, without consuming my entire life for the preceeding three months writing Chef cookbooks and wrestling EC2, sounds fantastic.</p>

<h3>Cloud Foundry</h3>

<p>Having played with Heroku, and being dismayed at not being able to play with my own Heroku, I was overjoyed when VMWare released Cloud Foundry. I created a Vagrant box on the Cloud Foundry release day and began distributing it to clients. I worked with one of my clients at the time, OpenCredo, to develop and deploy one of their new services to a Cloud Foundry installation I created. I believe this was the first SLA-led production deployment of Cloud Foundry globally.</p>

<p>I spoke about the rationale behind running/developing your own PaaS at QCon London 2012. I also discussed some of the use cases I&rsquo;d fulfilled using PaaS, including OpenCredo&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Lessons-Learned-in-Deploying-PaaS">QCon 2012 &ndash; Lessons Learned Deploying PaaS</a></p>

<h3>OpenShift</h3>

<p>I was similarly happy when I heard RedHat had bought Makara, a product I&rsquo;d briefly experimented with, and were looking at producing their own PaaS. I&rsquo;ve used RedHat-based systems for many years with great success, have always found <a href="/blog/2012/01/15/system-build-reproducibility/">YUM/RPM great to use</a>, and was apparently the 7th person in the UK to achieve RedHat Architect status. A RedHat-delivered PaaS would surely be the panacea for all my problems.</p>

<p>I was scoping a large project at this time with availability as a prime concern. It occurred to me that I could use two turnkey PaaSes simultaneously, Cloud Foundry and OpenShift, such that if there was an issue with either I could simply direct all traffic to the other PaaS. I discussed the deployment and progress at DevopsDays.</p>

<p><a href="http://new.livestream.com/devopsdaysorg/devopsdaysRome/videos/4516372">DevopsDays Rome 2012 &ndash; How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the PaaS</a> &ndash; I start about 32 minutes in.</p>

<h3>From Dream to Reality</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the project didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned. We had a number of issues with OpenShift which meant we had no choice but to withdraw it from production usage. Scalability was an enormous problem; bringing an application to production scale was a sub-twenty second operation in Cloud Foundry; it took fourty-eight hours plus in OpenShift. We had to write our own deployment and orchestration layer for OpenShift based on Chef and shell &ndash; Cloud Foundry has the fantastic BOSH tool enabling deployment, scaling, and upgrades. These reasons, alongside some nasty bugs and outages, meant we were unable to use OpenShift for our deployment.</p>

<p>Beyond this I feel OpenShift, like many &lsquo;PaaSish&rsquo; systems, has got the focus wrong. There seems to be a plethora of container-orchestration systems being produced at the moment, which are really just a slight re-focus on the IaaS abstraction layer. OpenShift is in danger of falling into this trap. PaaS needs to remain focussed on the application as the unit of currency, and not the container or virtual machine. It looks entirely possible (and would make an interesting project) to run Cloud Foundry inside OpenShift, illustrating the conceptual difference.</p>

<p>We settled on using distributed Cloud Foundry instances across diverse IaaS providers to deliver the project; it was a great success. I blogged about it for Cloud Foundry&rsquo;s blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/04/30/uk-charity-raises-record-donations-powered-by-cloud-foundry/">CloudFoundry.com blog post &ndash; UK Charity Raises Record Donations Powered by Cloud Foundry</a></p>

<h3>Which PaaS?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve remained supportive of RedHat&rsquo;s efforts to deliver a PaaS solution but fear they&rsquo;re not quite there yet. I organised a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-PaaS-User-Group-LOPUG/events/120336492/">London PaaS User Group meetup  to help RedHat to put their side of the case across to the London community</a>. It sounded like they had some exciting developments in the pipeline but even with the new features it&rsquo;s likely we would have been unable to deliver the enterprise-grade services our project required.</p>

<p>Perhaps Redhat&rsquo;s customer base are largely systems administrators rather than developers. Perhaps Redhat have more experience at deploying and managing servers than applications. For whatever reason, I think it would be a denigration of PaaS to allow it to be misconstrued as container-based IaaS. Containers can be a by-product of service provision but should not be the focus of PaaS.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry isn&rsquo;t perfect but, at the moment, is the only PaaS product I&rsquo;d recommend to anyone looking to make a long-term investment.</p>
